      # What You'll Learn

      * Why use version control
      * How to use Git
      * How to use GitHub
      * What a pull request is
      * Branches and why they're really smart

      # Why use version control

       - Version control records changes that are made so you can recall specific version later
       - Makes it possible for you to work on a feature/bug fix/release without changing production code
       - No more "file-version3.py" or "config-020315.conf"!
       - Since everything is pure text it's easy to "merge" new code into existing

      ---

      # Git

      A distributed version control system, where every user has a complete and full copy of the source code.

      If you can't check it in, you can't keep track of it, so you can't version it, so you can't automate it.

      *Everything* belongs in source code control, and git is the standard in 3rd platform.

      Other possible options: subversion (svn), mercurial (hg), Perforce (p4), ClearCase (cc).

      # GitHub

      A freemium service to host Git repositories (repos). Public repos are free, private ones are still cheap.

      Most open source projects are hosted and collaborated on here.

      > If you're not on GitHub you don't exist.
      -- Friendly developer

      # How does it work?

      1. Initialize a central repository
      2. Clone the repo
      3. Make changes
      4. Commit changes
      5. Push those changes to the central repo
      6. ...
      7. Profit!

      # Create a new repo

      ---

      # Clone the repo

      `git clone https://github.com/jonasrosland/training-repo.git`

      ---

      # Make changes

      `cd training-repo`

      `echo "Hello World" > yourname.txt`

      ---

      # Commit changes

      `git add yourname.txt`

      `git commit -m "added yourname.txt to the repo"`

      ---

      # Push changes

      `git push`

      ---

      # What happened?

      ---

      # DENIED!

      You're not allowed to push to this repo

      So how can we collaborate?

      Fork it!

      # Fork a repo

      ---

      # Clone _that_ repo instead of the original one

      `git clone https://github.com/<yourname>/training-repo`

      Repeat your changes, and try to push

      What happens?
