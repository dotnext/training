      # What You'll Learn

      * An introduction to DevOps Constructs and Buzzwords
      * Whats is a Continuous Integration
      * What is Continuous Deployment
      * Logging

      #DevOps Definition

      A **collaborative culture & philosophy** between technical teams, often **derived from modern software development methods**

      # DevOps Constructs and Buzzwords

      #Cloud Native Applications

      “Applications that do not require resilient infrastructure”

      # Microservices

      # Properties of a Microservice
      * Small code base
      * Easy to scale, deploy and throw away
      * Autonomous
      * Resilient
      
      ---

      # Benefits of a Microservices Architecture
      * A highly resilient, scalable and resource efficient application
      * Enables smaller development teams
      * Teams free to use the right languages and tools for the job
      * Rapid application development

      #Microservices Needs

      Microservices are great, but they require:
      * Rapid provisioning
      * Solid monitoring
      * Rapid deployment
      * DevOps culture

      ---

      # Continuous Integration

      * The practice of merging development work with a Master/Trunk/Mainline branch constantly so to test changes
      * Promote the code testing as often as possible to catch issues early
      * Most of the work is done by automated tests via a unit test framework
      * Typically there is a build server performing these tests, so developers can continue working while tests are being performed

      ---

      #Continuous Delivery
      * The continual delivery of code to an environment once the developer feels the code is ready to ship
      * Be it either UAT, Staging or Production environments
      * The idea is to be constantly deliverying code to a user base, whether it be QA or customers for continual review and inspection
      * Merges Continuous Integration with automated deployment, test and release
      * Doesn’t mean every change is deployed to production ASAP but ready to be deployed at any time

      ---

      #Phases of Continuous Delivery (too much?)

      * Unit Test
      * Code Quality Analysis
      * Deploy to Test Environment
      * Integration Test
      * Packaging and Archiving
      * Deploy to Preproduction Environment
      * Acceptance Test
      * Deploy to Production Environment

      ---

      #CI/CD Tools
      * Jenkins (https://jenkins.io/)
      * Travis CI (https://travis-ci.org/ )
      * Concourse (https://concourse-ci.org/)
      * Buildbot ( http://buildbot.net/ )
      * Strider ( http://stridercd.com/ )
      * Go (http://www.go.cd/ )
      * Integrity (http://integrity.github.io/ )

      ##Microservices Drive Requirements around Logs and Performance Monitoring

      * 10s or even 100s of microservices means a huge number of logs to comb through for an event
      * performance analytics become critical when you have thousands of users and interdependent services

      ---

      # Logging

      * log everything
      * no really, everything
      * [`chargers.cfapps.io` logs ~73 MB/day]

      ---

      # Logging Rules

      * app never concerns itself with routing or storage of its output stream
      * usually write to `stdout`
      * include deep information as to file, module, function, lineno
      * include a correlation id with every message
      * log in UTC
      * log with appropriate level: `debug` vs. `info` vs. `critical`

      ---

      # Logging Tools

      * use language-native tools for logging
        * python `logging`
        * node `winston` or `bunyan`
        * ruby `yell` or `logging`
      * configurable tools are better tools
      * multiple output streams are better
      * multiple logging levels are better

      ---

      # Log Management Tools

      * Splunk (http://www.splunk.com)
      * Loggly (http://www.loggly.com)
      * Logstash (https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash)
        * "ELK" stack - elasticsearch, logstash, kibana
      * Graylog2
      * **Many** others

      ---

      # Logging Tips
      * Send all logs to `stdout` **and** logging system
      * Set alerts on messages of give `type` per `minute|hour|whatever`
      * Use correlation id to track a given transaction/request
