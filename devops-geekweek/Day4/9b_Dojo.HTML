# What's a Dojo?
      
Dojo = A Japanese term which literally means "place of the way”.

	A room in which martial arts are practiced

# A Cloud Foundry Dojo
CLOUD FOUNDRY DOJO GOALS:

* Contribute to Cloud Foundry Foundation sanctioned OS projects
* Train new Cloud Foundry contributors 
* Innovate around the platform/infrastructure.

CLOUD FOUNDRY OS CONTRIBUTIONS & INNOVATION:

* Practice "the Way" a modern software development methodology (with techniques/culture coming from XP and Lean)
* Evangelize "The way" to Dell EMC Product teams

# Pair Programming
     
* Two developers writing code using 1! machine
* One implements the code (Driver)
* The other navigates and reviews the code (Observer)
* Both think about strategic implications
     
---
# Pair Programming Benefits
* Empathy
* Focus
* Better engagement
* Quicker on-ramp (as Pairs are rotating)
* Higher Code Quality
* Open and Continuous Communication
* Adaptive to Change

---

# Test driven Deployment (TDD)
How IT WORKS:

1. Write the test code first
2. Run the test (it MUST fail)
3. Write the code to made the test pass
4. Clean up the Code (Refactor)

---

# Test driven Deployment Benefits

* Quality of code (less and cleaner code / build small)
* Fast feedback (QA is immediate)
* Safety Net: code is tested very frequently/no big gaps
* Lean code / no waste

# Build Measure Learn Cycle

"How do we know we’re making progress?  By asking the customer"

The dominant question is not:

	"Can we build this product?"

But:

	"Should we build this product?"

# Retrospectives (Retros)

	"The sprint review looks at *what* the team is building, whereas the retrospective looks at *how* they are building it."

Three main questions/points for discussion:

    What went well during the sprint cycle?
    What went wrong during the sprint cycle?
    What could we do differently to improve?
	   
---
	    
# Retrospectives: Value

* **Whole Team learning** : have uncomfortable but necessary discussions
* **Generate Action** : Real Actions and change
* **Help solving team issues** : usually more challenging than Tech issues

# More Information

The last part of this session is delivered via a standard PowerPoint containing the latest and greatest coming from the Dojo Team.
