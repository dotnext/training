      #What's a Container Orchestrator?

      Container runtimes (runC, rkt ContainerD) are good at running containers on a single host. In a production environment you would probaly like to manage multiple hosts in order to create a scalable and highly available infrastructure. This can be attained by creating a central management unit. This unit is called *Container Orchestrator*.
      
      ---
      # Containers in production Needs
      Some examples are
      * resiliency/fault tolerance
      * Can scale
      * Optimize resource usage
      * Service discovery functionalities accross applications
      * Make workloads/containers accessible from the outside
      * Manage applications updates
      
      ---
      
      #Container orchestrators Examples
      
      * Kubernetes
      * Mesos Marathon
      * Docker Swarm
      * Hashicorp Nomad
      * Amazon ECS
      * Crossplane
       
      ---
      
      # Container Orchestrator Functions
      
      * Start containers on different hosts
      * Connect containers living on different hosts
      * Build services/high level constructs by grouping together containers and other elements (secrets, persistency etc)
      * Manage multiple hosts
      * Optimize and monitor the usage of resources accross hosts

      # Kubernetes 101

      "Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications."

      ## More Kubernetes Facts
      
      Also known as K8S (there are 8 letters between K and S... engineers :P )
      
      Kubernetes is a Greek term for "helmsman" or "pilot"
     
      Kubernetes is part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) along with other notable projects like rkt, containerd, Prometheus, Linkerd, CNI, Harbor and MORE.

      ## Who's using Kubernetes?
 
      * Box
      * eBay
      * Pearson
      * SAP
      * Wikimedia
      * Github
      * And many more

      ## Kubernetes Architecture

      * Master Nodes
      * Worker Nodes
      * Distributed key value store (etcd)

      ---
      
      ## Kubernetes Installation
      Kubernetes can be installed on:
      * Virtual machines
      * Bare Metal
      It can be installed on different OSes like for example CoreOS, RHEL, SUSE, Ubuntu etc
      
      ---
      
      ## Consuming Kubernetes 
      
      * Install on premises
      * Consume a Cloud provider offering based on K8s (GKE/Azure Container Services/Platform9)
      * Install it in a Cloud Provider infrastructure (GCP, Azure, AWS) manually or with specific tools
      
      ---

      # Kubernetes Installation Tools
      
      Some examples are:
      * kubeadm
      * Kubespray
      * BOSH (see Kubo/Cloud Foundry container runtime)
      * Kops
      
      Or you can install it from scratch following Kelsey Hightwower's "Kubernetes the hard way" book/github repo

      # Master Node


      * API Server
      * Scheduler
      * Controller Manager
      * etcd (optional can be external)
     
      ---
      
      # Worker Node
      Runs the applications using Pods and is controlled by the Master Node
      * Container runtime
      * kubelet (pods and containers, images, volumes, etc.)
      * kube-proxy (a simple network proxy and load balancer: it builds up services as defined via the Kubernetes API on each node and can do simple TCP and UDP stream forwarding)
      
      ---
      
      # etcd
      
      Key value store that serves as a datastore for the cluster state
      Also used to store configuration details such as subnets, Secrets, etc.

      * Heptio
      * Mesosphere 
      * Docker EE/CE

      # Kubernetes based *managed* Cloud Offerings (examples)
      
      * GKE (Google Container services)
      * AKS (Azure Container services)
      * EKS (Amazon Elastic container service)
      * Alibaba (Alibaba Cloud Container Service)

      # CNCF and Kubernetes Validation
      
      CNCF has a validation program for distributions and K8s based managerd services
      
      Aof Dec 2018 there are 86 versions validated (they were 32 on Dec 2017!!)
      
      You can check them here:

      # Kubernetes Hello world
      
      Type this command to test that your Kubernetes setup is working:
      
      ```
      kubectl run hi --quiet --rm --attach --restart=Never --image=alpine  -- sh -c 'sleep 3; echo "Hello from Kubernetes!"'
      ```
      
      You should get something like this:
