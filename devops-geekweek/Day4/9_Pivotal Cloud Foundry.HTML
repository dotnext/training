      #What's a PaaS?


      PaaS is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.

      ---
      # What is a Cloud Native Platform?
      Cloud-native platforms offer a super set of functionality over and above the earlier PaaS offerings.
      Not only they provide an abstraction of the IaaS layers offerered via self service but they add built-in features, such as:
      * resiliency
      * log aggregation
      * user management and security
      * Secrets management
      * and more!!
      
      ---
      
      #Cloud Native Platform
      
       The ultimate goal of a Cloud Native Platform is to *make the software* build, test, deploy, and scale *cycle significantly faster*
      
      ---
      
      # Why Cloud Foundry?
      

      ```
      > “Nobody has ever built cloud-native apps without a platform. They either build one themselves or they use Cloud Foundry.”
      
      -- Joshua McKenty, Field CTO of Pivotal Cloud Foundry

      # CF 101

      >what problems does it solve?

      * managing operating systems sucks.
      * managing runtimes sucks
      * managing deployment of dependencies sucks
      * managing application isolation sucks
      * managing deployment tasks sucks

      ## Process for deploying/scaling app on EC2 / EHC / etc

      1 Deploy VM (the easy part - handled by IaaS...CMDB?)
      2 Secure VM (or write some puppet)
      3 Install runtime (with what?  rpm?  tarball?)
      4 Install dependencies (or write some scripts)
      5 Install application (tarball? RPM? git?)
      6 Start application (how?  job engine?  keep it running?)
      7 Modify load balancer (how?)
      8 Modify firewall (how?)
      9 Add health checks (to where?  http? tcp? )

      ---

      ## Process for deploying app on CF

      * `cf push app_name`

      ## Process for scaling app on CF

      * `cf scale app_name -i instance_count`

      # Gorouter


      * Accepts requests for a specific 'route' (URL)
      * Passes them to available applications and instances assigned to that route (possibly more than 1)
      * Can be replaced by other load balancers if needed

      ---

      # Buildpacks
