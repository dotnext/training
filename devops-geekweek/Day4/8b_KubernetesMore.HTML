      #What's in a Pod?

      A pod is the simplest workload you can create in Kubernetes. It is a unit of deployment ie a single instance of an application.
      
      
      ---
      
      ## More on Pods
      
      A pod can contain:
      * one or more containers
      * storage resources
      * IP
      * Options to configure the Pod 
      
      A pod represents an application via a group of co-located containers
      Containers in a pod share the same network namespace
      
      A pod is *ephemeral* : it gets a new id if restarted

      # Kubernetes API
      
      Everything in Kubernetes is treated as an API object and has a corresponding entry in the API.
      
      How can you interact with Kubernetes?
      * using CLI commands (kubectl, kubeadm etc) 
      * or you can just access the REST API to view edit or delete elements in your Kubernetes installation
      
      For example to check the pods running:
      ```
      kubectl.exe create -f .\mysql-secret.yaml
      ```
      
      OR:
      ```
      curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/v1/nodes | jq '.items[] .metadata.labels'
      ```
      
      ---
      
      # Namespaces
      
      Namespaces are a way to segment your Kubernetes cluster in smaller chunks.
      
      They can be used to segment a physical cluster for different teams (App1, app2 etc) or different use cases (Production, QA, test etc).
      
      ---
      # Labels
      
      * key/value pair that is attached to a resource (for example a pod) 
      * user defined attribute thta is linked to a resource
      * useful for organizing resources/operating on them
      
      ---
      
      # Replica Sets
      
      Functions:
      * Maintain a certain number of Pods are running (declarative)
      * Restart pod in case of failures
      * Also useful for scaling up/down pods
      
      ---
      
      # Deployments
      
      A Deployment controller provides declarative updates for Pods and Replica Sets
      
      A deployment construct is used to
      * Scale the application to handle more load
      * Perform Rolling upgrades
      * Rollback upgrades
      
      Rates of upgrade can be controlled and stopped/restarted if needed
      It can also be tracked to to roll backs
      
      And in general define the *desired state* of a pod (in term of version installed, instances etc)
      
      ---

      ---
      # Stateful Sets
      
      * Give a unique identity to pods
      * Identity persists over pod redeschuling
      * Used when applications need stable network ids, persistent storage
      * Pods are created sequentially with ordinals suffixed to pod names (pod-0, pod-1..pod-N)
      
      ---
      # Stateful Sets Use case
      
      ![inline](../images/StatefulSets.png)
      
      ---
      # Daemon Sets
      
      The goal of a Daemon set is to have the same pod running on *all* nodes of a Kubernetes Cluster
      
      Useful for:
      * running agents
      * log collectors
      * monitoring systems (for nodes)
      
      
      ---
      
      # Volumes
      
      ---
      
      # Persistent Volumes
      
      * Create Persistent Volume (pv) resource
      * Create Persistence Volume Claim (pvc)
      * Write a manifest for a pod that uses this (persistent volume claim as a volume type)
      
      Since Kubernetes 1.6 you could use dynamic provisioning: with this Kubernetes creates a persistent volume corresponding to the claim made by the users. 
      Dynamic provisioning is supported by an API (StorageClass) that lets the administrator define a persistence volume provisoner of a certain type, then the user can self serve from that.
      ---
      
      # Secrets
      
      Some data (such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and ssh keys) must be handled with care so Kubernetes offers a Secrets API.
      
      This way you can keep configuration separated from the code in a true 12F way: 
      the secret is created independently from the pod/pods that uses it ;)
      
      ---
      
      # More on Secrets
      
      * Secrets are stored in the tmpfs of the container host running the pod and are made available only to the specific container(s) needing them.
      * Secrets are written unencrypted in etcd (as of Jan 2018)
      * Remember that base64 encoding is *NOT* an un acceptable form of encryption
      * Secret files can also be mounted as a volume type
      
      Check here for the (latest) best practices on handling secrets:

      # Services
      
      Defines a way to access a set of pods and a means by which to access them.
      You can provide things like a single stable IP address and DNS name.

      # Ingress
      
      Ingress, added in Kubernetes v1.1, exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. 
      
      Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the ingress resource.

      # Helm - High level Description
      
      Helm is used for easy deployment of complex configurations (pods, services, configmaps etc). 
      * Using a *Chart* (similar to a template file) you declare the required components and their relationships 
      * A local agent (called *Tiller* and installed inside the cluster) uses the API to install what is specified in the chart
      Helms looks like "orchestration for orchestration"
      
      A *Repository* is a collection of charts:
