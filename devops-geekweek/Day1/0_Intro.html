      #DevOps Agile Geek Week

      >Software & Infra do not scale. Software & Infra **teams** do not scale.
      >Architecture should be as much about enabling small teams to work on small components as the technical requirements of the software.

      #Git

      A distributed version control system, where every user has a complete and full copy of the source code.

      If you can't check it in, you can't keep track of it, so you can't version it, so you can't automate it.

      *Everything* belongs in source code control, and git is the standard in 3rd platform.

      Other possible options: subversion (svn), mercurial (hg), Perforce (p4), ClearCase (cc).

      ---

      #GitHub?

      A freemium service to host Git repositories (repos). Public repos are free, private ones are still cheap.

      Most open source projects are hosted and collaborated on here.

      ```
      > If you're not on GitHub you don't exists.
      -- Friendly developer
      ```
      ---

      #CloudFoundry CLI

      A command line tool for managing CloudFoundry applications and related services.  Again, all CLI so that it can be scripted and automated.

      Simple commands to deploy, scale and monitor applications.

      ---

      #PCF Dev

      A portable and lightweight Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) installation that runs as a single virtual machine (VM) on your workstation leveraging Virtualbox.
      PCF Dev is intended for application developers (or yourself!!) who want to develop and debug their applications locally on a PCF deployments avoiding a big/full PCF installation (that requires more hardware/effort).


      PCF Dev includes Pivotal Elastic Runtime, Redis, RabbitMQ, and MySQL. It also supports all cf CLI functionality.

      Alternatives: use Pivotal Web Services (A PCF installation running in AWS)

      #Slack

      Think of it like IRC on 'roids'. Team chat with multiple channels, integrations with services like GitHub, Trello, etc.

      Often used to significantly replace email within Agile teams.

      #Trello

      An online 'Kanban' board to track tasks and completion.

      Very simple and user friendly, can be used for anything from sprint management to planning a birthday party.
